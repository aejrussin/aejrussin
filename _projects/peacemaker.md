        <p>PEACEMAKER is a quickdraw roleplaying game where we play characters in a wild west showdown: the final confrontation to settle our dispute. We open on the finale of our feud — but we’ll play to find out how we got to this moment of desperate revenge through flashbacks. Together, we’ll create scenes about threats to the people, places, and things that matter to us most. Whoever wins a scene gets to decide the truth in the story of our feud.</p>
        <p>At the end of the game, we’ll return to the showdown. All of the decisions we made in each flashback will colour the dramatic tension between us. We’ll find out what’s at stake, what your feud cost, and how it impacts our chances of survival.</p>
        <p>To make peace, one of us needs to die.</p>

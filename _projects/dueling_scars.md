        <p>Dueling Scars is a fast, simple, single-page swordplay dice game for two players with 30 minutes. Evoking actual fencing tactical concepts, this game uses a d6 dice pool resolution system and a simplified version of position and effect from Forged in the Dark to drive daring strategic combat between two players.</p>
        <p>This game is best played when printed on an A4 or 8.3 x 11.7 inches (210 x 297 mm)​ sheet of paper, with 8 ~ 12 physical d6 dice and two tokens. It was developed in April 2022 as a mechanical proof-of-concept, and  I would love to hear about your experience playing it in the comments below.</p>
